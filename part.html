        <h1>Part Truckload</h1>
        <p>We operate one of the largest Partial Truckload Freight service segments in India focused on Corporate, Small and Medium Enterprises and retail segments at competitive rates.
            Our services are designed to meet your regular business as well as seasonal B2B requirements across the country â€“ with a combination of our own fleet and our professional truckload partners across India.
            Our shared network allows us to offer e-Commerce equivalent turnaround times via our proprietary mesh network</p>
        <p>Part Truckload (PTL) shipping is a logistics model designed to address the transportation needs of businesses with shipments that do not necessitate a full truck. It strikes a balance between Full Truckload (FTL) and Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) options, offering a tailored approach for cargo that falls in between these extremes.

            One of the key advantages of PTL is its flexibility. Unlike FTL, where shippers must fill an entire truck, PTL allows businesses to reserve and pay for only the space they require. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for smaller shipments or companies with irregular shipping needs, providing a cost-effective solution.

            Cost efficiency is a defining feature of PTL. By paying for the actual space used rather than the entire truck, businesses can achieve significant cost savings. This makes PTL an attractive option for companies seeking an economical shipping solution without committing to the higher costs associated with FTL.</p>
